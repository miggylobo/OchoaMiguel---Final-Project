## Description
### File Explanations
My project builds off of the rain.py project we did earlier in the semester but adds a cute twist on it. I have included 5 different png files of cat heads, which are royalty free, as well as 3 different sound effects found from the soundly library, which is also loyalty free. 
### Design Implementations
The 5 cat heads replace the generic shapes we used before, for both the particle and particle trails. I was able to include 3 interactive elements, which include:
Direction of the rain path being flipped 180 degrees on the y axis upon left mouse click, which can be done an infinite amount of times. 
Screen resolution size being reduced by half up to 2 times upon middle mouse button click, then being looped back to the original resolution upon a 3rd middle mouse button click.
New trails being spawned upon right mouse button click anywhere on the screen, spawning on cursor position. When a new trail is spawned, it follows the rules of the other trails, including reversing direction upon left mouse button click. When new trails are spawned, a random meow sound effect will be triggered, randomly choosing between 3 sounds that are listed in the src folder. 
## Design considerations and future areas of improvement
I wanted to make cat rain with various cat sprites and tail trails, however, I was unable to figure out how to make the tail trails work properly, thus I decided to cut it. This allowed me to focus on other areas of improvements and implementations, so it was a necessary loss. In the future, I would like to be able to add tail trails and have more forms of cats appear, including the face of my cat, which I was unfortunately not able to include. I did enjoy working on this, just wish I planned it out better.
