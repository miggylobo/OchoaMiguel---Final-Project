# Cat Rain

## Repository
<Link to your project's public GitHub respository>

## Description
I will make a program that makes it rain cat heads! This will be similar to the rain trail lab we did a couple weeks ago, but with cats of different colors instead of simple particles. 
It is an art piece honoring my love of cats. You might even see my cat, Tajin in there! 
## Features
- Feature 1: Cats!
	- This will be executed by drawing different shapes to make cats!
- Feature 2: Tail Trails
	- This will use the idea of the particle trails from Rain.py, but with cat tails instead!
- Feature 3: All the cats! 
	- This will use a variety of cat breeds so that it wont just be one cat! 

## Challenges
- I will have to draw more shapes to make them look like cat heads. Will need to incorporate more circles as well. 
- Trying to figure out how to make the trails work will be a challenge, as they will be a different shape from what we did before. 
- Will need to find out how to randomize the cat varieties, while offereing a low chance of my cat showing up. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I have a variety of cat breeds and expressions that show up in the program. My cat makes an appearence every once in a while. Trails are specific to each cat breed. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Small variety of cat breeds show, with only one type of tail trail.

## Milestones

  1. Goal 1: Have a single cat head show up in the digital rain.
  3. Goal 2: Have a single tail show up in the particle trail. 

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1: Show different cat breeds, expressed with different colors. 
  2. Goal 2: Show different tail trails for the diffrerent breeds.
